This paper explores the cross-border effects of the US Government spending. I identify government spending ”news” and ”surprise” shocks in the US. Using a global VAR model we explore the international transmission of the US shocks in a set of 33 countries. Evidence suggest that the news shocks produce significant expansionary effects for all the countries in our sample while the effects of the surprise shock is negligible.

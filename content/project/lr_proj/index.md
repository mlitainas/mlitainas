This paper investigates the spatial spillovers of the Sectoral Shifts in the US states. Using a panel or 48 US states for a sample from 1990M01 to 2019M12 we find that the unemployment effect of labour reallocation across sectors occurring in the vicinity of a state is double in magnitude the effect of the reallocation happening in the state itself. Results are robust for different homogeneous and heterogeneous panel data estimators. Evidence suggests that neglecting the spatial spillovers of sectoral reallocation, can lead to a systematic underestimation of sectoral shifts effects.
